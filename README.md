# ChainHours
_Ethereum blockchain tokens for sharing an hour of your time with someone._

## Background
Around 2012, a handful of [communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_community_currencies_in_the_United_States) in the U.S created [time-based currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency).

Some of which included:
* Aloha Hours (Hawaii)
* Mile-high Hours (Denver)
* Humboldt Hours

While many of these 'currencies' are inactive for one reason or another (arguably the advent of blockchain), I find the notion interesting and worthy of consideration. The principle is that time is the only scarce resource to any individual.

Empirically, the market value for an hour of someones time does not equate among all activities and capabilities. I can't imagine a free world where an hour of heart surgery is worth that hour I spent cleaning out my neighbors gutters.

Aside from the intention to become a currency I see value in having an immutable way to share an hour of my time - any way I please.

I think the best way to do this on an immutable distributed ledger where a given hour can be created and redeemed only once. From there I'll let people decide how they want to use it.
